# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Snigdha Sukun

Iâ€™m a **Frontend Developer** originally from **India**, now living and working in the **Netherlands**. With over **6 years of experience**, I love building **clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications** â€” the kind that makes life easier for both users and developers.

My work mostly revolves around the **JavaScript ecosystem** â€” youâ€™ll often find me working with **React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and Express**. Along the way, Iâ€™ve also dabbled in **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and a bit of **Elasticsearch** for search optimization.
